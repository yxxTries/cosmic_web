Using this library you can:

Turn any sky survey catalog (with RA, Dec, z) into a 3D tracer catalog (Mpc).

Run DISPERSE on that catalog to extract the cosmic web skeleton.

For any particular filament spine (converted to a simple x y z polyline), compute:

Distance of each galaxy to that filament.

Position along the filament.

Put error bars on simple statistics using jackknife.

still need to:

Decide which galaxies to use as tracers (selection cuts).

Install and run DISPERSE.

Convert DISPERSE’s skeleton format into one or more x y z polylines.
